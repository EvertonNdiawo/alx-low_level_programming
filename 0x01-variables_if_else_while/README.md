This directory explores how C language handles variables, different data types and looping and conditional structures(if statement, if..else, if..else if..else and while loops).
The tasks are described in the list below:

0-positive_or_negative.c - A program that assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. 


	-The variable n will store a different value every time the program is run.

		-The output of the program should be:
			*The number, followed by
			*if the number is greater than 0: is positive
			*if the number is 0: is zero
			*if the number is less than 0: is negative
			
			*followed by a new line


1-last_digit.c - A variable that will assign a randomnumber to the variable n each time it is executed. 

	-The output should be:
	
		.The string 'Last digit of' followed by,	
		.n, follwed by,
		.The string is, followed by,
			*if last digit is greater than 5: 'and is greater than 5'
			*if last digit is 0: 'and is 0'
			*if last digit is less than 6 and not 0: 'and is less than 6 and not 0'
	
	
2-print_alphabet.c - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

			-Only allowed output functions, putchar, only twice allowed.
			-All code should be in the main function.

3-print_alphabets.c - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

			-Only output function allowed, putchar, three times only. 
			-All code should be in the main function.

4-print_alphabt.c - A program that prints the alpabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

			-Print all letters except q and e.
			-Only allowed output function is putchar, and only twice in entire code.
			-All code should be in the main function.

5-print_numbers.c - A program taht prints all the single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by the new line. All code should be in the main function.

6-print_numberz.c - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a newline.
			-Not allowed to use any variable of type char.
			-Only use putchar, and only twice in entire code.
			-All code should be in the main function.

7-print_tebahpla.c - A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a newline.

			-Only use putchar function, and twice only.
			-All code should be in the main function.

8-print_base16.c - A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a newline.
			-Only allowed function is puchar function, and three times only.
			-All code must be in the main function.

9-print_comb.c - A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
	
			-Numbers must be seperated by , followed by a space
			-Numbers should be printed in ascending order
			-Only allowed function for output if Putchar and only four times.
			-All code should be in main function.
			-No variable of type char is allowed.
