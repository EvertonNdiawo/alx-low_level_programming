#Singly Linked Lists

###Explanation

- Linked lists are a data structure in c programming language used to represent information either in links to each other, in circular trajectory or in a manner in which the item in between two items can have acccess to data on either side of it.

- Linked lists incorporate the concepts of __structures__, __typedef__ and __pointers__ to achieve this task.Be sure to look up these concepts before delving into tasks in this directory.

- A singly linked list is in such a manner that the node has two parts, the data and the pointer to the next node in the list.

- The list also contains the first node that is simply a pointer to the first actual node.This can technically be reffered as the list since it is the head of the list.

- The last item in the list points to NULL and is considered the tail of the list.
